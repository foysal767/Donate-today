            This part is pretty easy. Food banks accept dry and canned food
            donations. What does that mean? Basically, any food that is
            “shelf-stable” or nonperishable – you can keep it in your pantry and
            it won’t go bad.

          My Sunday school teachers had turned Bible narrative into children's
          fables. They talked about Noah and the ark because the story had
          animals in it. They failed to mention that this was when God massacred
          all of humanity.
